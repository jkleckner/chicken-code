**ForkOfTheChickenOfTheVNC (FotCotVNC)** is a modernized, high-performance, native VNC client for macOS. Based on the classic *Chicken of the VNC* codebase, this fork updates the application to run natively and smoothly on modern macOS architectures (including Apple Silicon and Intel) and modern display configurations.

## 🚀 Major Updates & Modernizations (Since last Chicken release in 2011)

FotCotVNC has undergone significant modernization to enhance stability, display performance, OS integration, and compatibility:

* **Dynamic Desktop Resizing**: Added support for resizable session windows when connected to VNC servers that support dynamic desktop resizing.
* **Retina Display & High-DPI Stability**: Fixed an off-by-one boundary checking bug in framebuffer drawing that caused out-of-bounds memory access and crashes on Retina screens.
* **Automatic Clipboard Synchronization**: Synchronizes clipboard content automatically when the session window gains focus or right before sending middle mouse button events.
* **UTF-8 Extended Clipboard Support**: Added support for the VNC "extended-clipboard" protocol, allowing seamless copy-paste transfer of non-ASCII and UTF-8 characters between macOS and the VNC server.


### ⚙️ Architecture & Build Modernization
* **Universal Binary Support**: Build target configurations updated to compile a Universal App (native `arm64` for Apple Silicon and `x86_64` for Intel).

### 🎨 Groundbreaking Branding
* **The "Liquid Glass" Visual Revolution**: We retired the charmingly retro, pixelated chicken icon and replaced it with a brand-new, ultra-glossy **"Liquid Glass" logo**. Sporting translucent, eye-straining 3D glassmorphism, it depicts our beloved chicken mascot paired with a dinner fork. Does it improve connection latency, fix memory leaks, or reduce CPU usage? Absolutely not. But it does make the app look like a premium, VC-funded SaaS utility, which we all know is the real measure of software engineering excellence.
